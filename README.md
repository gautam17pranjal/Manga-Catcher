# Manga Catcher
This is a personal project. This was done so that Manga chapters can be taken offline anywhere to read.
##
#### How to Use it:
 - The user needs to enter the starting chapter number and the last chapter number he/she wants to download in the variables "start", "last". For a single chapter both variable values will be same.
 - The user also needs to enter the Manga URL in the variable "manga_url" under the function "catch_chapter".
##
#### After running:
- The chapters will be saved in the location where the source file is present, under the Manga named folder.

Hope you enjoy reading offline!
